chef-browser
============

Easily browse through Chef data in a user-friendly format using your favorite browser. Chef-browser allows you to list (and search through) nodes, environments, roles and data bags (and items) as well as view their details: basic information plus pre-formatted JSON data. Shorten the time necessary to access often used information with saved searches.

## Installation

To install chef-browser, run:

```
$ bundle install
```

## Usage

Create a settings.rb file. Provide your server url, client name and the path to the client key. You can add additional connection options, but that's not necessary to run chef-browser properly. A full list of available options can be found in Ridley's [yard documentation](http://rubydoc.info/gems/ridley/Ridley/Client:initialize).

Run:

```
$ rackup config.ru
Puma 2.6.0 starting...
* Min threads: 0, max threads: 16
* Environment: development
* Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:9292
```

Go to http://0.0.0.0:9292.

You can define saved searches. To do that, open your settings.rb file and follow this syntax:

```ruby
node_search['MySQL Servers'] = 'mysql_server_root_password:*'
node_search['Staging'] = 'chef_environment:staging'
```

You can define as many saved searches as you like. Your saved searches will appear as a dropdown list next to the search box. Right now this option works only for nodes.

Chef-browser mimics knife's fuzzy searches, so entering "foo*" in the search box will result in performing a search for "tags:*foo* OR roles:*foo* OR fqdn:*foo* OR addresses:*foo*".

In order to save on bandwidth and memory, partial searches are enabled for users of Chef 11.0. If you use Chef 10.x, disable the `use_partial_search` option in your settings.rb file.

## Accessible data

Chef-browser allows you to access the following:
- nodes, environments, roles, data bags and cookbooks available on your server,
- details of each node:
    - name, ip address, fqdn, environment, tags, run list,
    - attributes presented using JSONpath in a handy, filterable table,
- details of each environment:
    - cookbooks and their versions,
    - default and override attributes,
- details of each role:
    - run lists and env_run_lists (if present),
    - default and override attributes,
- details of bags and data bag items,
- details of each cookbook:
    - name, description, metadata,
    - file list, recipe list,
    - display and/or download every file in a cookbook.

Where possible, tags, environment names and role views link to appropriate nodes, while run list elements link to other roles.

## Third party

Chef-browser is a Sinatra-based app. It uses [Ridley](http://github.com/RiotGames/ridley) to communicate with the Chef server. Handling configuration settings is done using the [Tinyconfig](http://github.com/3ofcoins/tinyconfig/) library. CSS & Javascript are provided by Twitter's Bootstrap. [jQuery.FilterTable](http://github.com/sunnywalker/jQuery.FilterTable) was used to help present data.

## Safety

By default, chef-browser publishes content without any access control, and authentication is left to the proxy server. If you use Chef below version 12.0, content can be secured by a login page, which requires a username and password to validate against users registered in the Chef server (just as the original Chef Web UI). To limit access with a login page, set the `login` option to `true` in the settings file.

When login is required, Chef-browser uses Rack sessions. By default, on each restart, a fresh, random session secret is generated. This logs out every user, and can be annoying. To save secret across restarts, generate a random string (e.g. by running `ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.base64(36)'`) and add it to `settings.rb` as `cookie_secret`.

## Ruby versions

Chef-browser works with Ruby versions: 1.9.3, 2.0.0, 2.1.0 and 2.2.1 (JRuby and RBX should work, but haven't been tested properly yet).

* Fork the repo.
* Create a branch from the develop branch and name it 'feature/name-of-feature': `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature` (We follow [this branching model] (http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/))
* Make sure you test your new feature.
* Commit your changes together with specs for them: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
* Push your changes to your feature branch.
* Submit a pull request to the **develop** repository. Describe your feature in the pull request. Make sure you commit the specs.
* A pull request does not necessarily need to represent the final, finished feature. Feel free to treat it as a base for discussion.
